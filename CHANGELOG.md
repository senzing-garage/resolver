- RPM based installation

## [1.0.1] - 2019-10-01

### Changed in 1.0.1

- "Prime the pump" when the docker containers comes up.
  This mitigates the lag seen on first access by initializing Senzing
  at `docker run` time rather than first HTTP request.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-08-15

### Added in 1.0.0

- Subcommands:
  - `resolver.py service`
  - `resolver.py file-input`
- Note: a "batch mode" datasource/entity-type configurator was attempted,  but was replaced with "on the fly" configuration.
  Reason: File-based iterators could not be reset, so two iterators would be needed -- potentially bloating memory.
  The use of a single iterator was preferred as this is more in line with "stream based" thinking.
- **Note:** Uses the Senzing_API.tgz TarBall method of installation.
